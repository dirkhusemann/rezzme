pre-requisites
==============

rezzme is a PyQt4 based utility written in python. as such you need to
have the following pre-requisites installed:

* PyQt4 runtime, development libraries (>= PyQt4 4.3.3), and development tools
  - on ubuntu that is an `apt-get install python-qt4-dev pyqt4-dev-tools` away

* (windows) [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/)
* (windows) inno setup tools
* (mac osx) [py2app](http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html)

make sure you install these packages (and their dependencies).

next, you will need get the __rezzme source__ package (unless you already have it):

    % svn checkout http://forge.opensimulator.org/svn/rezzme

this instruction will checkout the latest available version of the
rezzme code base into the (newly create) `rezzme` directory.

if you later want to update to the latest available version, just go
into your `rezzme` directory and issue the following command:

    % svn update

that should retrieve all changes since the last update and give you
the latest available version.

building: linux
===============

once you have installed the pre-requisites, building the rezzme
package is just a matter of invoking:

    % make clean build

that will create a tar file in the `dist` directory,
`rezzme-VERSION.tar.bz2` (where VERSION is something like 7.0.4, for
example). this is the distributable rezzme package for linux (we are
working on debian packages and RPMs).


installation: linux
===================

installation on linux is quite simple:

    % cp rezzme-VERSION.tar.bz2 /tmp
    % cd /tmp
    % tar xvf rezzme-VERSION.tar.bz2
    % cd rezzme-VERSION
    % sudo python setup.py install

the last step will provide you with some further informations about
the install process.


building: windows
