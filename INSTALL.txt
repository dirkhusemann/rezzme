_[draft document --- work in progress]_

pre-requisites
==============

rezzme is a PyQt4 based utility written in python. as such you need to
have the following pre-requisites installed:

* python (>=2.4)

  - (ubuntu/debian) if python is not already installed as part of your
    linux install, do 

        apt-get install python

  - (windows) use the windows installer from the [python download
    site](http://www.python.org/download/) 

  - (mac osx) python is already installed on your mac...but...that's
    not going to work: see the instructions in the next section for
    what to do.

* PyQt4 runtime, development libraries (>= PyQt4 4.3.3), and development tools

  - (ubuntu/debian) this is just an 

        apt-get install python-qt4-dev pyqt4-dev-tools

  - (windows) use the windows installer from [the riverbank download
    page](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)

  - (mac osx) ok. things are a tad more complex on mac osx. well, did
    i say "tad"? scratch that, things are a lot more complicated on
    mac osx (yeah, and you thought mac osx was easy, me too...) it's
    so complex that the [folks at arstechnica wrote a nice
    tutorial][arstechnica] --- i suggest you hop over to [their
    page][arstechnica] and follow the setup instructions. you should
    also get `py2app` as part of the deal.

[arstechnica]: http://arstechnica.com/open-source/guides/2009/03/how-to-deploying-pyqt-applications-on-windows-and-mac-os-x.ars/2

* (windows) [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/)

* (windows) [inno setup tools](http://www.istool.org/) and [inno setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)

make sure you install these packages (and their dependencies).

next, you will need get the __rezzme source__ package (unless you already have it):

    % svn checkout http://forge.opensimulator.org/svn/rezzme

this instruction will checkout the latest available version of the
rezzme code base into the (newly create) `rezzme` directory.

if you later want to update to the latest available version, just go
into your `rezzme` directory and issue the following command:

    % svn update

that should retrieve all changes since the last update and give you
the latest available version.

building: linux
===============

once you have installed the pre-requisites, building the rezzme
package is just a matter of invoking:

    % make clean build

that will create a tar file in the `dist` directory,
`rezzme-VERSION.tar.bz2` (where VERSION is something like 7.0.4, for
example). this is the distributable rezzme package for linux (we are
working on debian packages and RPMs).


installation: linux
===================

installation on linux is quite simple:

    % cp rezzme-VERSION.tar.bz2 /tmp
    % cd /tmp
    % tar xvf rezzme-VERSION.tar.bz2
    % cd rezzme-VERSION
    % sudo python setup.py install

the last step will provide you with some further informations about
the install process.


building: windows
=================

building on windows is almost as easy as building on linux, we start
again with

    % make clean build

you'll notice that after a bit of mucking around the make process will
eventually (sooner if you've got a faster machine than i have) start
_inno setup tool_ for you: just type <CTRL><F9> to kick of the setup
installer compilation. at the end of the compilation _inno setup tool_
will ask you whether you want to test the installer: i usually give it
a go, just to check whether everything works out as expected.

you will end up with a nice installer executable. 


installing: windows
