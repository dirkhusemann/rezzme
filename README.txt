rezzme launcher
===============

the rezzme launcher is a protocol handler that knows how to interpret
rezzme:// style URIs. the rezzme launcher tries to obtain sufficient
information from the target grid via the GridInfo protocol to
configure the virtual world client (usually the SecondLife(R)
client). 

windows installer note
======================

unless you **quit any running rezzme system tray "icons", you will
have to reboot** once the rezzme installer has done its job. due to
the design of windows there is not much we can do about this. sorry.
